# Comp.h
instead of &lt;iostream> for cpp or &lt;stdio.h> for c use the comp.h header file for some minor (useless) additions to the language
---
### hello world code for c and cpp using comp.h

``` #include "comp.h" 
int mn() {
hw;
ret0;
} 
```
--- 
### as you can see this hello world code is much shorter 
### _cpp / c devs can get one step closer to insulting the (CPU hoarding) python devs_
